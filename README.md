# Models-to-Predict-Customers-Churn

In this project, our aim is to building a model for predicting churn. Churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. Thus, in the given dataset, our label will be Churn column.

**Steps**
1. Read the churn.csv file and describe it.
2. Make at least 4 different analysis on Exploratory Data Analysis section.
3. Pre-process the dataset to get ready for ML application. (Check missing data and handle them, can we need to do scaling or feature extraction etc.)
4. Define appropriate evaluation metric for our case (classification).
5. Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and one other appropriate algorithm which you can choose from scikit-learn library.
6. Is there any overfitting and underfitting? Interpret your results and try to overcome if there is any problem in a new section.
7. Create confusion metrics for each algorithm and display Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1-Score values.
8. Analyse and compare results of 3 algorithms.
9. Select best performing model based on evaluation metric you chose on test dataset.
